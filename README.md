Lets get started
1. version numbering has been changed to be in sync with intellij. This has no impact on developers but it will help developers who are using both Intellij and AndroidStudio to link the features.

Intellij Version 	Old Name 	  Old - Number System 	New - Year System 	New Version Name
2020.3 	          4.3 	      4.3.0 	              2020.3.1 	          Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1

New Formar for version numbering is explained below
<Year of IntelliJ Version>.<IntelliJ major version>.<Studio major version>.<Studio minor/patch version>

    * The first two number groups represent the version of the IntellIj platform that a particular Android Studio release is based on. For this release, it's version 2020.3.
    * The third number group represents the Studio major version, starting at 1 and incrementing by one for every major release.
    * The fourth number group represents the Studio minor/patch version, starting at 1 and incrementing by one for every minor release.
    We are also giving each major release a version name, incrementing from A to Z based on animal names. This release is named Arctic Fox.
